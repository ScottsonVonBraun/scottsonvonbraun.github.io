                powerful men in the entire city, he doesn’t have much of a backbone. Donald Blue was arrested by the Task Force after a gruesome battle. His Holy Brand ability is called 
                Water Weaving, which gives him the power to use the water in his body as a weapon. Donald was in prison after being arrested by Don Pink and the Task Force, but he was

                <h4>Donovan Pink</h4>
                A menacing man who was the former Don Pink and is also the father of the current Don Pink, Donna. Donovan is considered by many to be the TRUE Don Pink, 
                as his daughter, Donna, takes orders from him. Donovan is known for controlling the Knight Force with an iron fist, doing whatever is necessary to achieve
                justice. Donovan trained his oldest daughter, Blondie, before she ran away. It is believed that his Holy Brand ability makes it so that the damage that 
                he inflicts on others cannot be healed through magical means. Donovan gave Cyrus a scar on his face, and he brutally beat JB. Donovan was upset that 
                Donatello Green was allowed to live. Donovan tried to take over Newtopia, but his plans were foiled by the Task Force and friends. Donovan was killed 
                by his daughter, Blondie.

                A doctor who controled many of the Hospitals in Newtopia City. He is dating Medusa, much to the dismay of her previous boyfriend, Stuart. 
                Donatello helped Loxa Land by sending medical help there after the war in Loxa Land. Donatello worked together with the Loxo Rebellion to 
                try to take over Newtopia City by turning everyone there into elephants, but his plans were foiled by the Task Force and his own fiancé, Medusa.
                He is currently in prison.

                A young prodigy who leads the Knight Force. She's a big fan of the Task Force after their recent appearance on the Frank Bevuchet Show. Despite being only 14,
                she is easily one of the most terrifyingly strong people in all of Newtopia City, and her potential for growth is even more frightening. Her father, Donovan, put
                her through brutal training, and even got Donatello Green to turn her into a super soldier. Her Holy Brand ability is called Lovely Guardian, which gives her the 
                power to protect the people she loves by forming protective auras around them. Over time, Donna became more andmore subservient to her father; eventually leading 
                to her joining Donovan in his attempt at overthrowing the king. She was defeated by the Task Force and is now in knight custody. Donna became Letalia's Assistant 
                after Letalia became Don Yellow.

                and brawn are required for a person to be perfect; and she always strives for perfection. Doneisha is eternally young thanks to her Holy Brand ability that she got from 
                the god of youth, Frigalhei. She manipulated everyone into believing that she and Cyrus had some sort of romantic relationship, but it was all apart of a game
                for her own entertainment. Don Yellow left Newtopia to go to the Mountains of Honor. She kidnapped young women and used them as sacrifices to her god in exchange for 
                eternal youth. The whereabouts of Don Yellow are currently unknown.

                Gobo Rescue Operation.

                An elf blood hunter with a warped sense of justice. Julian in most regards was a pretty alright dude. He was vegan and had a PhD in Applied Magical Arts. However, Julian’s downfall 
                was his hotheadedness and his twisted beliefs of right and wrong. After killing a witness involved in a case and shooting his boss, JB, he ended up being sentenced to death, and 
                he had his head sliced in two by Oxford the Ox. However, Julian was revealed to actually still be alive and working as the Knight Hunter, a serial killer who kills knights at night.
                Julian escaped from jail and is was helping out his friend, Mida. However, Fiver recaptured Julian and sent him back to prison. After being interrogated and having his memories restored,
                Julian revealed that he was revived by Doneisha.

                After being confronted by the Task Force, he gave himself up and spilled the beans on his drug operation. Julian promised to help Mida and potentially
                work out some sort of deal, but Julian's death stopped all further agreements. Mida escaped from jail and is now working with Julian to find Mida's family.
