                <h4>Aphelios Ross</h4>
                A loxodon fighter who will always battle in the name of the law. Aphelios has a strong sense of justice and will not let anyone or anything get in the 
                way of what he believes is right. Being a very large man and coming from the distant Loxoland, means he is often an outsider wherever he goes. 
                However, even in the face of discrimination, he wishes to do good and become a man of honor. He has a legion of fans called the Aphelios Ross Fanclub. He's
                currently sponsored by a shoe company called Rad Kicks. Aphelios wears size 15 shoes. Aphelios was a contestant on Hottest Star Island, and got 1st Place. 
                Aphelios became the leader of the Task Force after Gobo left.

                An elf blood hunter with a warped sense of justice. Julian in most regards was a pretty alright dude. He was vegan and had a PhD in Applied Magical Arts. However, Julian’s downfall 
                was his hotheadedness and his twisted beliefs of right and wrong. After killing a witness involved in a case and shooting his boss, JB, he ended up being sentenced to death, and 
                he had his head sliced in two by Oxford the Ox. However, Julian was revealed to actually still be alive and working as the Knight Hunter, a serial killer who kills knights at night.
                Julian escaped from jail and is now helping out his friend, Mida.

                sentence was changed to house arrest. He became friends with Aphelios. Mikey is online friends with Eileen and Fiver, despite not knowing their real identities.

                <h4>Wyatt</h4>
                A young man who murdered his own cousin, Xavier, because Xavier stole his lunch money when they were in the second grade. Wyatt got help from his
                other cousin, Zeke, in disposing of the body. Wyatt escaped from jail with his friend Cheeto. Wyatt was accidentally killed by Arnold, as Wyatt was 
                far too weak to withstand Arnold's attack.
