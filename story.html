            <h1>Starless Saga</h1>
            <h2>Le Elegante Overdose</h2>

            The King’s Secret Knight Task Force began its first mission! Le Elegante Academy, Letalia’s alma mater,  
            was once one of the most prestigious schools in all of Newtopia City. However, tragedy struck the 
            esteemed academy when one of its students, Adan Ford, mysteriously perished. The student’s death was determined 
            to be an overdose, and after interrogating students and teachers at the school, it was discovered 
            that the man who supplied the drugs was a small-time dealer, named Mida Bendo. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force then took some time to rest. Julian and Letalia hung out at a burger shop and while they were getting acquainted, 
            Aphelios befriended Chaddeus, a cool bodybuilder at the gym. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force confronted Mida while 
            he was on his shift working at the movie theater, and while Mida was originally aggressive, he eventually 
            gave himself up to protect his family. In exchange for his family's protection, Mida handed over intel on 
            the whereabouts of his team’s drug warehouse, leading to the capture of Lucy, one of Mida's team members. 
            Lucy’s interrogation went wrong, leading to Julian, killing her. Julian then went nuts and shot JB!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Trial of Julian Hotapepperin</h2>

            Julian was captured and sentenced to trial for his assault on JB, the murder of Lucy, and other crimes 
            of police brutality. The ones preceding over the trial were three members of the Knights of Justice, the 12 
            strongest Knights on the force. Stuart the Rat was the prosecutor, Medusa the Snake was the bailiff, and 
            Oxford the Ox was the judge. Despite overwhelming evidence, Julian fought for his case until the bitter end, 
            losing all respect from those in the courtroom. After a botched attempt to escape, Oxford sliced Julian 
            in half with his Greataxe, killing him instantly. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Disappearance of Wendy Blue</h2>

            A dwarf named Arnold joined the Task Force as Julian's replacement. After Arnold joined the Task Force, 
            the team began their second mission. Don Blue, one of the five Dons who control most of Newtopia City, 
            reported the disappearance of his daughter, Wendy, who worked at the local corner store. Wendy's trail led 
            to a rundown apartment owned by her ex-boyfriend, Mikey. After interrogating Mikey, the team learned 
            that Mikey and Wendy had a falling out, and Wendy ran off to the Casino to make some quick cash in order to leave 
            the city. A series of unfortunate events led to Mikey’s subsequent arrest. The Casino was being ran by Don Red, who 
            allowed the team back to the VIP section where Wendy was being held, after Arnold survived a game of Russian Roulette
            with the Don. Wendy was being used as a sacrifice by Countess Baroba, for her ritual to the God of Youth, Frigalhei. 
            The Task Force was able to save Wendy and subdue Baroba, but right as they were about to leave, Baroba was taken 
            back by Don Red. The Task Force was disgusted by the blatant corruption running rampant in the city, but before they could
            make changes to the way that Newtopia was ran, the Task Force members would have to improve their Star Rankings.
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Bronze Assessment</h2>

            In order to obtain power and respect in the Knight Force, one must improve his Star Ranking. At that moment, the 
            Task Force members were all Starless, but by completing the Bronze Assessment, they could rank up to obtain their Bronze 
            Stars. After taking a day off on a trip to the movies, the following day, the team took the Bronze Assessment. 
            <p></p>
            The team went through three trials: a Knowledge Test, a Fitness Test, and a Combat Test. Along the way the team 
            met a strange group of fellow examinees known as the Ab Family, who annoyed and disrupted them at every turn during the exam. However, 
            by defeating the Ab Family in the Combat Test, the Task Force managed to pass the Bronze Assessment, 
            becoming Bronze Star Knights!
            <p></p><hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Bronze Star Saga</h1>

            <h2>Wet Willy Killer</h2>

            For their first mission as Bronze Star Knights, the Task Force investigated the mysterious Wet Willy Killer, a 
            serial killer known by his calling card: giving all of his victims wet willies. Letalia found out from one of the 
            victim's teachers that all of the victims were in the same class along with a strange loxo kid. The team staked out 
            the house of Nadine Waters, the last remaining girl in the friend group of all of the victims. After some strange 
            encounters with some of the neighbors, Nadine returned after going on a date with the loxo guy, named Cheeto. Cheeto 
            was then revealed to be the Wet Willy Killer! Aphelios tried to reason with Cheeto, as they were both from Loxa Land, 
            but unfortunately, Cheeto was too far gone. 
            <p></p>
            While the team managed to subdue Cheeto, it wasn't before Cheeto managed 
            to slit Nadine's throat. Sadly, Nadine succumbed to her injuries, and died. The Task Force was left feeling defeated, 
            but JB reminded them that they must shine on, even in the darkest of nights!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Don Blue’s Party</h2>

            The Task Force was visited by Stuart the Rat and Medusa the Snake, two of the Knights of Justice from Julian’s trial. 
            Medusa distracted Arnold by taking him out for dinner, and Stuart forced everyone else to stick to the story that Julian 
            was actually a hero, to protect the reputation of the Knight Force. Letalia hung out with her friend, Wendy and they watched
            a movie together. Arnold and Aphelios went to the gym to meet Chaddeus, but Chaddeus' friend, Gobo, challenged Arnold to
            a push-up competition. Gobo lost pretty badly. 
            <p></p>
            Later, the Task Force was given a strange request by Don Blue 
            to act as bouncers for a party he was throwing for his daughter, Wendy. The Task Force did well as bouncers (aside from
            an incident with a Fake Wendy), but at the end of their night, they were approached by Countess Baroba and Don Red! 
            While Arnold tried to stand his ground, he sensed the insane power of Don Red and was scared into running away. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Mother’s Day Maniac</h2>

            While on patrol, the Task Force encountered a member of the Society of Evil, an infamous group of villains. 
            After infiltrating the Society of Evil, the Task Force had a meeting that was interrupted by Kenny the Knight, who informed them that a 
            distress call had come in from a cabin in the woods, known as The Cabin. The team visited The Cabin and found the body of a girl, who’d 
            been beaten to death. Arnold and Letalia tried to find the source of a scream they heard and came face to face with a Very Large Man 
            who had one of the vacationing college students, Billy, cornered. Arnold and Letalia were no match for the Large Man’s power, 
            so they were all forced to flee on Letalia’s back, after she transformed into a horse. 
            <p></p>
            Meanwhile, Aphelios stayed back at The Cabin 
            to keep watch over the other students: Logan, Martin, and Violet. Martin tried to convince the team to cut their losses and escape, 
            as he believed the Very Large Man to be the Mother’s Day Maniac, a deranged killer who had murdered a bunch of teenagers a few years ago. However, 
            Martin ended up in an argument with Logan, as Logan didn't want to leave his friends behind, leading to a fight where Martin ended up 
            falling down the stairs and breaking his neck, killing him. 
            <p></p>
            The Mother’s Day Maniac made it back to The Cabin, and so did a crying Violet, 
            who was carrying the dead body of her dear friend, Shauna, Billy’s girlfriend. With everyone's combined effort, the Task Force and 
            the college students were able to defeat the Mother’s Day Maniac, who was revealed to be Violet’s brother, Barry Bones! 
            Violet and Barry were working together in this killer operation, so both were arrested. Logan was also arrested for the accidental 
            murder of Martin. Billy decided to become a Knight, under Arnold’s tutelage.   
            <p></p><hr>  

            <h2>Frank Bevuchet Show</h2>
            The Task Force were told by Stuart and Medusa that they were invited on to the most famous talk show in Newtopia City, The Frank Bevuchet Show,
            for catching the famous Mother's Day Maniac. On Frank's show, the Task Force gained a ton of popularity for their great responses. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force
            was visited by the leader of the Knight Force, Don Pink. Don Pink became a huge fan of the Task Force after their talk show appearance. 
            Don Pink arm wrestled Arnold and sent him crashing through a glass table, creating a crater in the ground. Don Pink made the next Bronze Assessment
            happen quicker so that the Task Force could become proctors for it. Proctoring a Bronze Assessment is a requirement to take the Silver Trial and become a 
            Silver Star Knight. The Task Force learned of the true power of the Dons, which they most likely got from their Holy Brands, 
            tatoo-like marks caused by forming pacts with gods. 
            <p></p>
            While on Patrol, the Task Force met a girl who was being robbed. It turned out that the girl was Cheeta,
            the little sister of Cheeto the Wet Willy Killer. Originally she wanted to kill Aphelios for putting her brother in jail, but she realized that jail might be the best
            thing to help rehabilitate Cheeto. Cheeta then fell in love with Aphelios and became the leader of the Aphelios Ross Fan Club. Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia 
            all got calls from companies who wanted to sponsor them. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force then proctored the next Bronze Assessment, where the Ab Family all passed. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Silver Trial</h2>
            
            The Task Force got a call from the Society of Evil, informing them that the leader of the society had requested them. The leader of the Society of Evil,
            Flat Top, is a young man who desperately wanted to change the Society of Evil for the better. Flat Top believed that being evil was outdated and uncool, and he
            wanted to make the Society of Evil good. The Society of Evil had a bad reputation because of the actions of the previous leaders, and Flat Top thought that the Task
            Force could help with that thanks to their new found popularity. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force took on the Silver Trial! The first test was a Psychological
            Evaluation where The Task Force were asked questions about their goals and their beliefs. The second test was an Interrogation Test, where the Task
            Force figured out that a young man named Xavier was killed by his cousin, Wyatt. Their other cousin, Zeke, helped hide the body. Kenny broke Wyatt's
            leg and Aphelios didn't like that. Kenny and Aphelios then engaged in a fight! Despite originally trying to stay uninvolved, Letalia and Arnold helped
            Aphelios in his fight, earning the respect of Kenny, allowing them to pass the secret last part of the Exam, the Friendship Test. The Task Force then became
            Silver Star Knights! 
            <p></p>
            JB explained his history as a Knight of Justice who lost his rank because he was trying to expose the Dons. 
            <p></p><hr>
            <br>
            
           <h1>Silver Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Father's Day Fun</h2>

           The Task Force met up at Alain's Bar for drinks to celebrate their passing of the Silver Trial. Alain allowed the Task Force to enter the VIP section of
           the bar since all of the members had at least a Silver Star. There the Task Force encountered Violet Bones! She's now working as a singer at the bar.
           Violet managed to avoid jail time by pinning all of her responsibility in the Mother's Day Maniac murders on her brother; claiming that he manipulated her
           into helping him kill college students. Arnold managed to get Violet's number, though. 
           <p></p>
           Cliff, Cyrus, and Ned all entered the VIP section and hung out with
           their kids on the Task Force. Each dad taught their kid a new technique. Letalia learned Incinerate, Arnold learned Muscle Expansion, and Aphelios learned 
           Super Salute. Overall it was a fun Father's Day. 
           <p></p>
           Don Pink scheduled a meeting with the King, and the Task Force went to meet him. The Task Force was stopped
           by Gobo, who revealed that he is a Gold Star Knight. Gobo didn't want the Task Force bothering the King. Aphelios managed to get Gobo to agree to a staring
           contest with Letalia, and Gobo lost. Gobo tried leaving, but Arnold gave him a wedgie, so Gobo beat Arnold up. The Task Force met the King, who
           nearly executed the team, but Aphelios managed to get the King to agree to investigate the Dons. The King asked Aphelios and the Task Force to befriend his 
           son Gobo.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Investigation of Don Blue</h2>

           JB got some intel from the King that Don Blue may be up to no good. JB asked the Task Force to interrogate Mikey, because Mikey lived in an apartment that's
           secretly owned by Don Blue. Mikey was willing to give information on Don Blue, but first he wanted his jail time reduced. Aphelios managed to work out a 
           deal with Mikey: house arrest for the remainder of Mikey's sentence in exchange for information on Don Blue. Mikey revelead that Don Blue has been cutting all 
           sorts of corners on Mikey's apartment building and that Don Blue has turned a blind eye to all sorts of illegal activity. Don Pink agreed to help the Task Force 
           apprehend Don Blue. Don Pink showed the Task Force her Holy Brand power, Lovely Guardian, which should help protect the Task Force members in a fight. 
           <p></p>
           The Task 
           Force set up a friendly meeting with Don Blue to arrest him, but he eventually realized that this was just a ruse. The Task Force managed to defeat Don Blue, 
           though Don Pink was badly injured and Letalia nearly died.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Jailbound</h2>
           Kenny ran into the Task Force office and told everyone to check out the news. Abraham was announced dead on the news, and his body was located 
           at North Newtopia Hospital. Catherine and Ryu came in and arrested JB for his connection with Don Blue. This arrest order came from Don Pink. The Task Force 
           went to see Don Pink, and she explained that her father made her arrest JB. The Task Force went to see Donovan Pink. Donovan revealed that he was suspicious 
           of all of the Task Force for the missions they took for Don Blue and their relationships with Don Blue’s daughter, Wendy Blue.  Donovan asked Arnold to arrest 
           Letalia, but Arnold refused. Donovan asked Aphelios to arrest Letalia, but he refused as well. Donovan got Don Pink, Ryu, and Catherine to arrest Aphelios, 
           Arnold, and Letalia. Donovan, Ryu, and Catherine failed to get a confession out of the Task Force. Donovan told Don Pink to break Aphelios’s legs but she ran off. 
           Ryu failed to get a confession out of Arnold. Letalia spoke sheep with Catherine, which caused Catherine to fail to get a confession as well. Don Red came in 
           and pulled some strings to get everyone out of jail. He said that he got the order to let you guys out from Medusa. 
           <p></p>
           Don Red told Letalia that he babysat her 
           as a kid, that they went on roller coasters together, and that he is best friends with her father, Cyrus Winters. Letalia called Cyrus and he was very disappointed 
           that Letalia was arrested and that she had been interacting with Don Red. After a very heated conversation, Cyrus grounded Letalia, and Letalia scheduled a 
           meeting with her dad and her mother to talk about things over lunch.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Hospital Visit</h2>
           Eileen called Aphelios and informed him that JB was in the hospital! He had a heart attack from the stress of being arrested. The Task Force went to visit JB and he was
           in decent shape. Kenny visited JB and made sure he was alright before taking Eileen home. Cyrus and Letalia's mother, Evelyn, came to visit JB. Arnold tried to hit on 
           Letalia's mom, much to Letalia's dismay. 
           <p></p>
           Cyrus revealed his history with Don Red. Don Red, Don Yellow, and Cyrus were all friends at one point, before Cyrus realized that 
           they were corrupt. Cyrus investigated the Dons, but he was found out by Donovan Pink. Cyrus was saved by JB, but Cyrus was left with a scar from the encounter, and JB was beaten 
           so badly that he was severely weakened from his previous state as a powerful Knight of Justice. Cyrus and Letalia made up after an apology from Cyrus and a hug; although, Letalia 
           did try to record Cyrus's apology, before being reprimanded by her mother. 
           <p></p>
           Don Green entered the room with Medusa. Medusa revealed that Don Green is her boyfriend. Don Green is JB's 
           doctor, but Don Green took far more interest in Aphelios's body. Stuart came in and started a fight with Don Green. Aphelios was nearly knocked out from the ensuing chaos, but the 
           Task Force managed to persuade Stuart to stop. 
           <p></p>
           Stuart informed the Task Force that they had an upcoming appearance on the Frank Bevuchet Show and that they were suspended for the 
           time being. Letalia scheduled a meeting with a very upset Wendy to talk about what happened with her father, Don Blue. Aphelios and Arnold hung out with Chaddeus at the gym where he 
           informed them that he is the captain of the Letalia Love Brigade. 
           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Don Summit</h2>
           The Task Force went to the Frank Bevuchet Show and after a brief conversation with Chet Ryan, they went onstage
           and were weirded out by the questions that fans were asking. Frank Bevuchet got a message from one of his producers that a dead body was found outside of the building! The body 
           belonged to none other, than the Task Force's friend, Kenny the Knight. Ryu and Catherine came onto the scene and told the Task Force to return to HQ. 
           <p></p>
           Gobo is now the captain of 
           the Task Force while JB is in the hospital. The Task Force was chosen to act as bodyguards for the upcoming Don Summit. Letalia chose to protect Don Yellow, Aphelios chose to protect
           Don Red, and Arnold chose to protect Wendy, who was representing Don Blue. During the time before the Don Summit, Letalia made amends with Wendy, Arnold began dating Violet Bones, and Aphelios befriended Mikey
           after bringing him a copy of Badfellas on DVD. 
           <p></p>
           Letalia learned that Don Yellow is immortal thanks to her Holy Brand that she received from Frigalhei. Aphelios learned that Countess
           Baroba has a close connection to Don Red. Arnold mended his relationship with Wendy.
           <p></p>
           At the Don Summit, Donald Blue was pressured into resigning, and Donald chose Wendy as his successor.
           Don Pink tried to fight Don Red over it, but she couldn't manage to hit Don Red. Don Yellow revealed to Arnold that she is his aunt-in-law, and that his mother is not actually his birth
           mother. Don Yellow also revealed that Arnold's birth mother is the sister of Julian's mother, meaning Arnold and Julian are cousins.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Knight Hunter</h2>
           The Task Force went to the Nasty Burger for team bonding, where they encountered the waiter, Rick. After burgers, the Task Force went to the Society of Evil Hideout where they found
           out that Flat Top and Gobo are friends, and that the Society of Evil is trying to stop the Dons. The Hideout is going to be the Task Force's new base of operations. 
           The Task Force had some internal arguments, as Aphelios wanted to take down all of the Dons while Letalia and Arnold believed that they should help Wendy. The Task Force decided 
           that Don Green was the best person to target first. Blondie revealed that Donovan Pink is her father and that he gave her the scar on her eye. The Task Force left the Hideout to talk to
           Wendy, though, Gobo stayed back to watch Night of the Living Poop. 
           <p></p>
           On the way to Wendy's place, the Task Force was approached by a masked man who revealed himself to be
           the Knight Hunter, the serial killer who murdered Abraham and Kenny. The Task Force managed to defeat the Knight Hunter with an excellent feat of teamwork by combining 
           Disarming Attack with Command with Hold Person. Aphelios unmasked the killer and revealed his true identity: Julian Hotapepperin! Aphelios and Letalia wanted nothing to do with Julian,
           but Arnold was less antagonizing, since Julian is his cousin, causing a bit of turmoil in the group. 
           <p></p>
           Gobo regrouped with the Task Force and took Julian back to Knight Force HQ. 
           The Task Force met with Wendy and her bodyguard, Craig. Wendy wants to take down the Dons since they betrayed her father. After a passionate discussion with Wendy, the Task Force 
           agreed to become her personal bodyguards.

           <p></p><hr> 
           
            <h2>Hottest Star Island</h2>
            Chet Ryan invited the Task Force to be on his new reality show, Hottest Star Island, where contestants complete challenges to win 50K Gold and a promotion to Gold Star Knight. 
            The Task Force decided to go; they were joined by the other contestants and they were all split into two teams, Plasma Camp and Nebula Camp. Plasma consisted of Aphelios, 
            Abigail, Flat Top, and Wendy. Nebula consisted of Arnold, Abel, Violet and Letalia. The team that loses the challenge must vote off one of their members, and in the event 
            of a tie, the decision is left to a fan vote. 
            <p></p>
            After a series of competitions, betrayals, and  exits, the teams merged into the Star Team, consisting of Arnold, Letalia, 
            Aphelios, Violet, and Flat Top. The Final Two ended up being Letalia and Aphelios. Aphelios won the game with a 4-2 vote! Aphelios gave 10K Gold to Arnold, and Chet Ryan 
            gave 10K Gold to Letalia for being the Runner Up.

           <h1>Gold Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Return to Newtopia</h2>
           The Task Force returned home after their trip to Hottest Star Island. Ryu gave Aphelios his Gold Star, officially making him a Gold Star Knight! 
           <p></p>
           Gobo informed the Task Force that 
           his father, the King, was ill, so Gobo would be stepping down from the position as the leader of the Task Force to take care of him. With Gobo gone, Chester joined, and 
           Aphelios was then made the new leader of the Task Force, given that he had the rank of Gold Star Knight. The Task Force met up at JB's house, where JB informed them that he had 
           decided to retire after many long years of being a Knight. Eileen told the Task Force that she was now working at the North Newtopia Hospital. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios and Letalia went to go see
           the Hottest Star Island: Behind the Scenes movie, where they found out that a second season of the show was coming out soon. Meanwhile, Arnold trained with Chester and Chaddeus
           at the gym. Chester could not handle Arnold's intense regimen, so Chester went home. The Task Force went to go see Flat Top, and he told them that a ton of new people joined the 
           Society of Evil after seeing Flat Top on Hottest Star Island. Flat Top also suggested that he and Aphelios should make a brand named after their alliance on Hottest Star Island,
           "Flat Peanuts". Flat Top also informed Arnold that Violet had released her new album, "Murderous Intent", and one of the songs, called "Arnie You Suck", was a very harsh critique 
           of Arnold. Arnold called Violet, and she said that the reason why she made the song was because Arnold betrayed her by voting her off of the show on Hottest Star Island. Arnold and 
           Violet decided to break up.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Jack Pepper Appears</h2>
           On his way home, Aphelios was greeted by a mysterious man, who turned out to be Jack Pepper, the leader of the Loxo Rebellion, who are trying to take over Newtopia and Loxa Land!
           Jack Pepper wants to make Newtopia and Loxa Land pay for how awfully loxos were treated in both places. Jack also wants revenge for his father's death at the hands of Aphelios' 
           father, Cliff Ross. Aphelios called his father, Cliff, and Cliff said that he did hear rumors that Carlos had a son. Cliff told Aphelios to investigate Don Green as Don Green had been 
           paying visits to Loxa Land. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios met up with Cheeta at Nasty Burger, and Cheeta, reluctantly, informed Aphelios about Jack Pepper, who was planning to start a war in Newtopia
           and in Loxo Land. Aphelios met up with Letalia, and they both interviewed Cheeto. Aphelios threatened Cheeto's sister, Cheeta, with jail time for working with the rebellion
           if Cheeto didn't give up information, so Cheeto told Aphelios that Aphelios didn't experience all of the struggles that loxos like Jack, Cheeta, and Cheeto himself experienced 
           because Aphelios grew up as a rich loxodon. Things were tough for loxos in Loxa Land, and they were also treated harshly in Newtopia. Jack met up with Cheeto prior to Cheeto's 
           incarceration. Jack informed Cheeto that a rebellion was brewing, and that Jack had been making super soldiers with the help of Don Green. Arnold met up with his cousin, Julian, 
           and Julian said that he had survived his head being split open because he was a god. 
           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Zombie Panic</h2>
           Arnold met up with Aphelios and Letalia at the North Newtopia Hospital. The Task Force heard a scream, so they
           ran inside and found out that Chaddeus and Eileen were being attacked by zombies! Chaddeus ended up getting bit by a zombie, but Letalia used her expert knowledge on zombies from 
           watching Night of the Living Poop to inform Arnold that to heal Chaddeus from his disease, Arnold would need to use Lay on Hands. 
           <p></p>
           After curing Chaddeus and saving Eileen, the Task 
           Force went into the basement of the hospital to save more people being attacked. The three people that were in danger were a woman named Bri, Abel Ab, and Abigail Ab. After being 
           saved, Bri tried to escape, but Letalia managed to stop her. Bri is actually named Abrielle, and she's the mother of Abel and Abigail! Abrielle tried to revive her dead son,
           Abraham, causing him, and other dead people to come back as zombies. Letalia threatened Abrielle with death if she didn't give up information on what was going on, so she offered
           to tell everything in exchange for a deal.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Loxo Rebellion War</h2>

           The loxo duo of Jean Parma and Khan A. Meri showed up and attacked! Jean was taken down when he was caught in Khan’s fireball. Abigail managed to stab Jean in the back and take him 
           down. Gobo called Aphelios and said that there’d been loxo attacks all over the city. The Task Force and co. took the loxos back to HQ. Chester joined up with the team. 
           <p></p>
           Suddenly 
           there was a loud noise! Aphelios got a call from JB saying to check the news. There’d been a jailbreak! The Task Force went to Wendy’s house to check on her and on the way they saw 
           Julian and Mida. Mida and Julian were going to get Mida to his family, and the Task Force let them go. The Task Force took Wendy and her bodyguard Craig to the Society of Evil for 
           protection. The Task Force went to the jail where they found Donald Blue who was one of the few who didn’t decide to leave. Donald said that the jailbreak was an inside job by a guy 
           named Chili Cheese. Aphelios invited Donald to help in exchange for a reduced sentence and house arrest. Arnold called Don Yellow and got her to help the Task Force fight criminals. 
           Arnold got a call from Violet who was being attacked by her brother, the Mother’s Day Maniac. Donald and Chester went to go help Violet. Aphelios called Cliff and during the call, 
           Loxa Land went into chaos. Aphelios called Mikey, and Mikey told Aphelios that Wyatt’s hang out is 123 42nd Street. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force couldn’t get in contact with Cheeta, so they decided 
           to go to Cheeta’s house to check on her, but on the way they ran into Wyatt, Cheeto, and Chili Cheese. Billy, Logan, and Louisa showed up to help fight the bad guys. They told the 
           Task Force to leave while they handled the trio of bad guys, but Aphelios opted to fight alongside Billy, and he told Logan to protect Louisa. Arnold accidentally killed Wyatt with a 
           single strike of his blade. After Chili Cheese and Wyatt were defeated, Cheeto eventually realized he was outmatched, so he surrendered. Arnold got a call from Don Yellow, and she gave
           him the address to Don Green's Secret Lab where Cheeta was being held. 
           <p></p>
           At the lab, the Task Force encountered Jack Pepper, his ally Ago Asi, and another sleepy loxo. While the Task
           Force fought Jack Pepper and co., Cheeta was being held in the back of the lab where Don Green was working on starting the Elephant Instrumentality Machine. This machine had the power
           to transform everyone in Newtopia into elephants. The Loxo Rebellion's plan was to use the power of the Newtopian citizens that were transformed into elephants to overthrow Loxo Land.
           After defeating Jack Pepper and co., the Task Force rescued Cheeta and destroyed the Elephant Instrumentality Machine. While trying to destroy the machine, Aphelios accidentally shot 
           Cheeta. Don Green was infuriated, and he attacked the Task Force. The Task Force realized they had no chance against Don Green, so they ran away with the help of Medusa who had 
           arrived on the scene. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force returned to their office where they found Chester and Donald who had finished saving Violet from Barry. Letalia called Wendy and allowed her 
           to talk with her father, which made him cry tears of joy. Aphelios kept his word to Donald and allowed him to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Aphelios 
           gave Billy a letter of recommendation to become a Starless Knight as thanks for Billy's help during the war.
           <p></p>
           Billy came in and said to check the news. Frank Bevuchet announced that the villains had been apprehended, and thus the war was over. The Knight of Justice, Fiver the Rabbit, 
           came into the Task Force office and dropped off Julian who he defeated easily. Fiver wanted to befriend the Task Force but they were skeptical of him.
           <p></p>
           Aphelios made the decision to have Letalia hang out with Chester while Aphelios and Arnold went to check on the King. Chester revealed to Letalia that he isn’t much of a fighter, 
           and that he prefers to keep his head down and take a backseat role. Chesters social skills suck, which is why he failed the Interrogation part of the Silver Trial. Aphelios and 
           Arnold met Gobo and the sick King at the hospital. The King expressed that he knows Gobo will become a great king, and that Gobo should find a woman to start a family with.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force regrouped at the office, then Medusa, Stuart, and Ryu showed up. Medusa and Stuart promoted Arnold and Letalia to Gold Star Knights. Stuart announced that the 
           Task Force is officially disbanded! 

           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Trial of Don Green</h2>

           Donna ordered the Task Force to come with her, but Aphelios and Arnold were hesitant to do so. Eventually, the Task Force ended up relenting to Donna, and they went to Donovan Pink’s office. 
           Donovan wanted the Task Force to serve as witnesses for Don Green’s trial. 
           <p></p>
           Letalia met up with Chet Ryan at the Bevuchet studio,and she agreed to star in his new movie, the Silence of the Rams. Don Red showed up at the studio and announced that he’d be 
           in the movie as well. Aphelios visited the Society of Evil, where Flat Top announced that he was working on Flat Peanuts merch, and Aphelios offered to connect Flat Top with Rad 
           Kicks to potentially make a Flat Peanuts sneaker. Arnold got texts from both Violet and Wendy, and Arnold decided to meet up with Wendy. Arnold agreed to train Wendy so she can 
           become a powerful Don. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force participated in the Trial of Don Green, where Jack Pepper, Chili Cheese, and Jack Pepper also served as witnesses. Oxford the Ox was the judge, Stuart was the prosecutor, 
           and Medusa was the bailiff. For some reason, the Loxo Rebellion members tried to take all of the blame for the war from Don Green, but the Task Force managed to disprove their statements. 
           Don Green was determined to be guilty, and the judge ordered that he be sentenced to death. Don Green then stated that killing him would be a mistake, as his medical expertise was 
           invaluable to Newtopia. Oxford decided to go through with the death penalty, but the new king, Gobo objected, and ordered that Don Green’s fate be decided with a vote. All Knights 
           ranked Silver Star or higher would vote on whether Don Green should live or die. 
           <p></p>
           Donna visited the Task Force to ask them who they were voting for, as she was going to vote for Don Green’s death. The Task Force did not tell her, and they questioned if she’d be able to send 
           her own father to his death if he were in Don Green’s place. After Donna left, the Task Force debated what they should vote for and how they should handle Donna. Aphelios thought that she 
           should be treated no differently than the other Don’s, but Letalia and Arnold were more sympathetic to her, as she was being manipulated by Donovan Pink. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force decided to go visit Chili Cheese in jail to find out why he and his allies were so quick to give up themselves for Don Green. Fiver came into the room after hearing the 
           Team’s conversation. He asked if they could hang out and play games, but the Task Force wasn’t receptive, so Fiver decided to follow through on his orders to kill the Task Force. Apparently, 
           people who were higher up wanted the Task Force gone, as they had grown too powerful. The Task Force managed to convince Fiver to let them go, but only under the condition that they play games 
           with him everyday at 7PM for a few hours. Everyone then went to the game store to pre-order the new game, Golden Dark Online.

           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>Golden Dark Online - Beta</h2>

           The Task Force went to the game store where Louisa works and pre-ordered Golden Dark Online. The Beta was currently out, so Fiver took the Task Force back to his messy room to play 
           the game on his high-spec PCs with Virtual Reality headsets. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios chose the username PeanutWarrior6. Arnold chose the username Arnold_6_9_8. Letalia chose the username BurningRose. Fiver introduced the Task Force to his online buddies: the abrasive 
           and rude, ApheliosFanXD aka Fifi, and the chill and laid-back, sweet_tooth_237 aka Sweet. The Task Force took on the Dungeon of Death where they fought a group of dangerous creatures, most 
           notably a beast with multiple blood-sucking minions. 
           <p></p>
           After beating the dungeon,  the Task Force spent some free time in the real world. Aphelios checked up on JB, Arnold began training Wendy, and Letalia worked on her blog. The next 
           day, Aphelios accidentally revealed his identity to FiFi and Sweet. FiFi then revealed that she was Eileen and Sweet revealed that he was Mikey. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force along with Fiver, Eileen, and Mikey, took on the Glacierflame Cavern. There were various moments of uncertainty, like Aphelios repeatedly falling off of a tightrope, 
           Fiver repeatedly falling down while climbing a wall, and Letalia being trapped in an icy prison dimension, but the team managed to complete the dungeon.
           <p></p>
           Aphelios tried to reason with Fiver to get him to lessen the amount of time that they played the game together, but Fiver wasn’t hearing it. Letalia and Arnold tried to log out, but 
           for some reason the command wasn’t working. Fiver somehow removed the Task Force’s ability to leave the game. Fiver decided that he would keep the Task Force trapped in the game 
           forever in exchange for allowing them to keep their lives. Aphelios told Eileen to go get help, so she logged out, but Fiver logged out after her. Fiver returned a few minutes later, 
           and he menacingly implied that he had dealt with Eileen somehow. Fiver offered to let the Task Force go free, but only if they participated in one last game. The Task Force decided 
           to call his bluff, and they refused to play his games any longer. Fiver then left, leaving the Task Force to be stuck in Golden Dark Online, forever…
           <p></p>
           While Aphelios was away, Arnold, Letalia, and a player named QUEENxN fought a rowdy player named XxswagsenatorxX with her at the bar. QUEENxN is a big fan of Arnold, and is the captain 
           of the Arnoldnites. Her boyfriend exilXking showed up after the fight, and everyone exchanged friend invites. Elieen returned and said that Fiver threatened to hurt JB if the Task Force 
           didn’t play his game. Fiver promised that he’d let everyone go if they defeated him. After an arduous three-phase battle, Mikey, Eileen, Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia managed to beat Fiver 
           and earn their freedom from the game! The Task Force arrested Fiver and took him to jail.

           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>Letalia's Birthday Party</h2>

           The Task Force voted for whether they thought Don Green should live or die. Aphelios voted for Don Green to die, but Arnold and Letalia voted for Don Green to live, sparing his life. 
           <p></p>
           Letalia spoke with her father on the phone which led to them meeting in person where he confirmed that he and Don Yellow were just friends. Cyrus hated Dons and the evil corruption that 
           they represent, which caused his friendship with Don Red and Don Yellow to end. More than anything he doesn’t want Letalia to become intertwined with the Dons. Aphelios met up with Don 
           Red because Aphelios wants to be a Don in order to make Newtopia a better place. Arnold trained with Wendy again and he realized that she had grown even stronger than himself in a short 
           amount of time. Arnold sensed a power similar to Don Red’s aura brewing inside of Wendy. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios got the Task Force to go to JB’s house where there was a surprise party for Letalia. In real life, QUEENxN is named Nina, and she came to Letalia’s party with her boyfriend 
           Chris to see Arnold. Arnold autographed her chin. Don Red showed up to the party with an ice cream cake for Letalia. Don Yellow showed up and caused chaos by getting everyone to 
           suspect that her and Cyrus were romantically involved at some point. Even Letalia was unsure at one point, but it was revealed that Don Yellow was just playing around. Letalia 
           revealed to everyone that she had thoughts of becoming a Don, much to Cyru’s dismay. Don Yellow said that Letalia reminded her of herself, Arnold reminded her of Cyrus, and Aphelios 
           reminded her of Don Red. Letalia and Aphelios are interested in the idea of becoming Dons, and Arnold wants to help Wendy become a better Don.

           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>Gobo Rescue Operation</h2>

           Chester called Aphelios and said that Donovan Pink, Donna, and his Knights of Justice had infiltrated King Gobo’s castle! Chester said that Gobo had sealed himself in the King’s 
           Chamber, and that the Task Force would have to assemble a team to come save Gobo. Wendy, Nina, and Chris went to go get reinforcements to help save Gobo. 
           <p></p>
           Meanwhile, the Task Force went to the King’s Castle, where they found Stuart guarding the entrance. Stuart split into four different people known as the Coalition of Rats! After defeating the Coalition of 
           Rats, the Task Force met up with Nina, Blondie, Medusa, and Billy. Medusa took Stuart to prison while the others went inside. 
           <p></p>
           Fiver appeared, so Blondie and Nina stayed to fight him while the Task Force and Billy went further into the castle. After sneaking past a few guards, the Task Force made it into a 
           room filled with traps! Arnold fell into a pit of glue being watched over by the Glue Goblin. Billy accidentally set off an acid trap that instantly knocked him out. Despite some 
           annoyances, the Task Force managed to defeat the Glue Goblin and her cronies with ease. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force were approached by Cyrus and Evelyn. Cyrus got into an argument with Letalia about her friendship with Wendy, and Cyrus disowned her. Aphelios found his father in a 
           jail cell. Cliff said that Gobo locked him in here, and Gobo was planning to use Don Green’s super soldier research to become the strongest warrior on the planet! Cliff didn’t approve 
           of Aphelios trying to become a Don. Cliff took Aphelios’s hat. Arnold got a call from Ned saying that Arnold’s mother was sick. Billy noticed that it was weird that everyone’s dad’s 
           were in trouble, and realized that this must be some sort of trick. Catherine and Ryu revealed themselves to have caused all of the turmoil. Catherine and Ryu aren’t fighters, so they 
           allowed the Task Force to go on. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force met a Knights of Justice duo, Akira and Rush. Akira summoned her pet dragon, Bessie and a battle began! It looked like the Task Force 
           wouldn’t be able to handle these new foes, but luckily, Wendy, Blondie, Cyrus, and Evelyn showed up to help out! With their combined powers, the Task Force managed to defeat Akira, 
           Rush, and Bessie. Wendy revealed that she has a Holy Brand ability that lets her transfer energy from one person to another. Evelyn found Aphelios’ hat and gave it back to him. Cyrus, 
           Evelyn, and Wendy transferred their energies to Letalia, Aphelios, and Arnold, restoring the Task Force back to full strength. Cyrus, Evelyn, and Wnedy then left the castle to rest. 
           Blondie told the Task Force not to hold back against Donna, and they agreed to go all out. The Final Five of Aphelios, Arnold, Billy, Blondie, and Letalia braced themselves for a 
           climactic confrontation with Donna and Donovan Pink!
           <p></p>
           The Final Five entered the King’s Throne Room where they saw Gobo struggling in a fight against Donna and Donovan. Luckily, Chester came in and rescued Gobo, allowing the Final 
           Five to face off against Donna and Donovan. Donovan revealed that Blondie’s real name is Doniella Pink. The fight was extremely brutal. Letalia was left with a permanent scar 
           on her left arm due to Donovan’s Holy Brand ability. However, eventually Donna was defeated. Aphelios used Donna’s incapacitated state to his advantage; threatening to kill her 
           if Donovan didn’t stand down. After shooting Donna, sending her extremely close to death, Donovan gave up to protect his daughter’s life. Blondie aimed her shotgun at Donovan’s 
           head, resolving to kill him. Arnold was originally against the idea, however, eventually all of the Task Force members left the room, allowing Blondie to end her father Donovan’s 
           life.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force visited Gobo at the hospital. Chester criticized the Task Force for allowing Blondie to kill Donovan, as it’s a Knight’s duty to protect. Gobo needed some time to 
           decide the consequences for the Task Force’s actions.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force were greeted in their office by Chet Ryan. Don Red showed up as well with his new girlfriend, Violet Bones! Chet Ryan offered Aphelios and Arnold a chance to be in 
           Silence of the Rams, along with Letalia. Aphelios and Arnold agreed, and thus shooting for the movie began. The movie unfortunately ended up being a flop, causing Chet Ryan to cry 
           in despair. Billy was very upset at Arnold because Arnold dated Violet, the woman who helped murder all of his friends back at The Cabin. 

           Gobo eventually met with the Task Force and he decided as a result of their actions, they’d be promoted to Platinum Star Knights! Gobo believes in the Task Force, and he trusts 
           that they made the right decision with Donovan and Donna. Gobo then told them that their next mission was to interrogate Julian Hotapepperin in order to figure out how he came 
           back to life.

           <p></p><hr>
           <br>

           <h1>Platinum Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Interrogation of Julian Hotapepperin</h2>
           Abel was already interrogating Julian. Julian said that he was revived by the great goddess Alaverata, the Goddess of Veganism. Abel suggested that he may have had his memories 
           manipulated. Medusa assisted the investigation by using Identify to determine that Julian was under the influence of a Modify Memory spell. Letalia contacted her mother, who came 
           to the interrogation room and used Greater Restoration to end the Modify Memory spell. Julian revealed that he had been revived by Don Yellow! After relaying the news back to Gobo, 
           Gobo instructed the Task Force to go to the Mountains of Honor where Don Yellow was located, and apprehend her for her crime of bringing someone back to life. The punishment for 
           bringing someone back to life is death, and death for the person that was brought back.

           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>Preparing for the Mountains of Honor</h2>
           Arnold and Letalia chatted at the Nasty Burger about their goals. They both wanted to either become Dons or abolish the Dons altogether and start a new system. Arnold and Wendy got 
           frozen yogurt. Arnold became Wendy’s right-hand man, and she told him that she wanted to start a war with Don Red. Medusa met with the Task Force and she told them that she wanted 
           them to be in her and Don Green’s wedding. The Task Force refused at first, but she then offered to get Don Green to take Donna’s powers away in exchange for the Task Force’s 
           attendance. The Task Force talked with Donna, and while at first she seemed combative, after learning that she was a super soldier that was experimented on by Don Green, she 
           eventually started being more open to being good again. Flat Top informed the Task Force that he wanted to be a Don, and that he was working with Wendy. Wendy sent the Task Force on 
           a mission to get rent money from Obi Omar who was throwing a party. Obi Omar agreed to pay up in a week after Letalia got Chaddeus to press Obi. Aphelios hired Jack Pepper and his 
           men to be a part of his personal guard. Arnold tried to make amends with Billy, but Billy wasn’t too interested. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force made their way to Loxa Land by boat to pick up two Knights of Justice who would be accompanying them on their trip to the Mountains of Honor. One of the knights was 
           Wilbur the Boar, who was the annoying player called the Swag Senator on Golden Dark Online. The other was Tania the Tiger, who’s real name is Letania Winters. Tania is the daughter 
           of Cyrus’s brother, Leo. The Task Force visited Aphelios’ home where they met Aphelios’ mother, Heather Ross. During dinner, Aphelios talked with his father about his plans for the 
           future.

           <h2>Calvard: Arnold's Hometown</h2>

           The Task Force left Loxa Land and sailed to the Mountains of Honor. Aphelios got seasick. On the trip to the Mountains of Honor, the Task Force saw a post on Goldengram with Frank 
           Bevuchet announcing that Flat Top was given the position of Don Green! 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force made it to Calvard, Arnold’s hometown in the Mountains of Honor. They met up with Ned and Arnold’s mom, Arlina. Arlina introduced Arnold to Ivanna, a big fan of his. 
           Calvard and several other settlements in the Mountains of Honor had been dealing with multiple cases of missing young women. Their investigation led them to an exclusive club 
           called Lovely Palace. After bribing the guards to get inside, they saw that Logan was working there as a bartender. Aphelios bribed Logan to get the password to get inside Lovely 
           Palace’s secret room. There, the Task Force encountered Don Yellow and Countess Baroba, who had sacrificed the young women to their god, Frigalhei, for eternal youth. 
           Wilbur and Tania ran away before they could get hurt. The Task Force tried to defeat Don Yellow, but they decided to back down after getting a taste of Don Yellow’s power. 
           Don Yellow said she wouldn’t return to Newtopia, and gave her Don title to Letalia. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force left the Lovely Palace, and Arnold went to see his master, Wayne at Mountain Lightning. Aphelios and Letalia talked to Gobo, and after being convinced by Aphelios, 
           he appointed Aphelios and Letalia as Don Pink and Don Yellow, respectively. Gobo decided that there should be a Don Summit to announce the news. Gobo expressed concerns that 
           Doneisha’s actions could cause problems with the International Committee. 
           
           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>The Finale - Part 1: The Plan to Asssasinate Don Red</h2>

           Arnold made it to the peak of Mountain Lightning where he fought Master Wayne. Arnold received his Katana of Lightning from Master Wayne and Master Wayne taught Arnold the 
           Lightning Slash.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force regrouped and returned to Newtopia. Gobo informed Aphelios and Letalia that they’d have to decide on their Don Crew. Oxford allowed the Task Force to pick their new 
           titles, which ended up being: Arnold the Monkey, Aphelios the Rat, and Letalia the Dragon. Gobo appointed Arnold as the leader of the New Task Force. Arnold mended his friendship 
           with Billy, and got Billy to join the New Task Force. However, Arnold couldn’t fix things with Violet. Aphelios ended Mikey’s sentence, and got him into the Knight Academy. 
           Aphelios chose Eileen to be his Consultant, Jack Pepper to be his Enforcer, and Cheeta to be his Assistant. Letalia chose Evelyn to be her Consultant, Cyrus to be her Enforcer, 
           and Donna to be her Assistant. Aphelios promised Jack Pepper than he would make things right for the Loxos in Loxa Land. 
           <p></p>
           Wendy met with Arnold and informed him of her and Flat Top’s plan to kill Don Red at the upcoming Don Summit. Flat Top worked with Donatello Green to create a special bullet 
           made using part of Donovan Pink’s body, which would cause damage that couldn’t be magically healed. Specs was going to be the one to fire the bullet from a sniper rifle. Arnold 
           secretly filled Aphelios and Letalia in on the plan, and Aphelios and Eileen met with Flat Top to discuss what was going on. Eileen expressed her discontent with this murder 
           attempt; believing that JB would never approve of it.
           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>The Finale - Part 2: The Last Don Summit</h2>

           Aphelios met with two members of the Knights of Justice, Marron the Horse, and Ruby the Rooster. Aphelios began working on a new ad campaign to get new people to join the Knight Force.
           Aphelios and Arnold managed to stop a criminal at the West Newtopia Bank who held hostages named The Dastardly Deidre by sending her to Don Red. Letalia implemented punishments for 
           student who don't show up for their classes. Letalia opted to not boost the grade of Jake McFarly, the star quarterback for the Le Elegante Tigers football team.
           <p></p>
           Aphelios and Letalia had a luncheon with Wendy in an attempt to get her to open up to them about her assasination plan, but it did not work. Arnold met up with Donald Blue and 
           Donatello Green to learn more about Wendy and Flat Top's operation. The Task Force spent some time with JB, who became a big fan of Golden Dark Online. JB gave some words of wisdom; 
           reminding the Task Force to all ways walk on the path of Golden Dark.
           <p></p>
           Don Red, Letalia, Aphelios, Wendy, Flat Top, Blondie, Arnold, Tania, Jack Pepper, Cyrus, Gobo, and Ruby all met up for the Don Summit. Tania expressed concerns that the new Dons were 
           not qualified for their positions. Wendy confronted Don Red and gave the signal for Flat Top to call in the hit. Shockingly, when Flat Top sent the message to Specs to take the shot 
           at Don Red, Wendy was the one was shot instead! Arnold grabbed Wendy and rushed her to the hospital. Flat Top tried to deny everything at first, causing Aphelios to attempt to arrest 
           him but Blondie pulled out her shotgun on Aphelios! Eventually, Flat Top gave in and revealed everything. Aphelios and Letalia admitted that they had known about Wendy's plan. 
           Ruby managed to find and capture Specs. 
           <p></p>
           Gobo met with Arnold, Aphelios, and Letalia in Wendy's hospital room. Ruby brought Specs in and the Task Force interrogated him. They learned that Specs was secretly a double agent who 
           was truly working for Don Red! Gobo was disappointed in Aphelios, Letalia, and all of the Dons in general, so Gobo decided to abolish the Don System! Gobo, Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia 
           went to the Red Casino for one final confrontation with Donte Red. Donte revealed that he had obtained his Holy Brand by sacrifcing his own parents.
           <p></p><hr>
           
           <h2>The Finale - Part 3: The Future is Shining Bright</h2>

           The Task Force engaged in a battle with Donte Red! Donte's Holy Brand, Shining Star, gives him the power to use star power. This power can cause devastating damage and even blind
           enemies. The Task Force went through an incredibly tough battle where Arnold, Aphelios and even Gobo were downed, but they managed to defeat Donte Red! Don Red was taken to prison.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force regrouped at Wendy's hospital room. Wendy wanted to take responsibility for everything that happened. Aphelios believed that Flat Top should receive some leniency. 
           Arnold and Letalia believed that Wendy should receive some leniency, but Aphelios disagreed! A big argument between the three Task Force members ensued. Gobo decided that Wendy,
           Flat Top, and Blondie would all get 5 years in prison, and 5 years under house arrest. Donna would be sent to a juvenile detention center and undergo rehabilitation until she is 18.
           Gobo offered Letalia a role as a professor at the Knight Academy. Letalia accepted the role. Gobo offered Aphelios a role as the leader of the World Justice Committee, where he would 
           work alongside Cliff. The Committee's goal is to stop racism and prejudice against the Loxos and Loxodons. Aphelios needed some time to think on his decision. Gobo asked Arnold if 
           he had decided on the members of the New Task Force, but Arnold needed some time to think. Arnold interviewed Chaddeus for a spot on the New Task Force, but Chaddeus wasn't 
           interested.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force went to dinner at the VIP section of Alain's bar. Arnold and Letalia were in good spirits, but Aphelios revealed that he was upset about Doneisha getting away and 
           Wendy receiving a light punishment. The Task Force discussed their thoughts on the situation before leaving the bar. The Task Force met with Gobo in his throne room. Letalia decided 
           that she would be a history teacher at the Knight Academy. Aphelios decided to join the World Justice Committee, and he brought Eileen onto the Committe with him. Arnold chose the 
           members of the New Task Force: Billy, Nina, and Mikey. Arnold would also be doing part-time teacher as a Gym instructor at the Knight Academy. Aphelios apologized to Gobo, Arnold, 
           and Letalia for his recent actions and statements. The Task Force went to JB's house for one last meeting as a team, along with Gobo and Chester. Eileen took some pictures of the 
           team. Medusa stopped by and asked if the Task Force would come to her wedding, but they refused. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia all went their separate ways. Each of them continued to shine on, even in the darkest of nights.
