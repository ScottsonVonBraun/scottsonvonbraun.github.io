            <h1>Starless Saga</h1>
            <h2>Le Elegante Overdose</h2>

            The King’s Secret Knight Task Force began its first mission! Le Elegante Academy, Letalia’s alma mater,  
            was once one of the most prestigious schools in all of Newtopia City. However, tragedy struck the 
            esteemed academy when one of its students, Adan Ford, mysteriously perished. The student’s death was determined 
            to be an overdose, and after interrogating students and teachers at the school, it was discovered 
            that the man who supplied the drugs was a small-time dealer, named Mida Bendo. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force then took some time to rest. Julian and Letalia hung out at a burger shop and while they were getting acquainted, 
            Aphelios befriended Chaddeus, a cool bodybuilder at the gym. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force confronted Mida while 
            he was on his shift working at the movie theater, and while Mida was originally aggressive, he eventually 
            gave himself up to protect his family. In exchange for his family's protection, Mida handed over intel on 
            the whereabouts of his team’s drug warehouse, leading to the capture of Lucy, one of Mida's team members. 
            Lucy’s interrogation went wrong, leading to Julian, killing her. Julian then went nuts and shot JB!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Trial of Julian Hotapepperin</h2>

            Julian was captured and sentenced to trial for his assault on JB, the murder of Lucy, and other crimes 
            of police brutality. The ones preceding over the trial were three members of the Knights of Justice, the 12 
            strongest Knights on the force. Stuart the Rat was the prosecutor, Medusa the Snake was the bailiff, and 
            Oxford the Ox was the judge. Despite overwhelming evidence, Julian fought for his case until the bitter end, 
            losing all respect from those in the courtroom. After a botched attempt to escape, Oxford sliced Julian 
            in half with his Greataxe, killing him instantly. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Disappearance of Wendy Blue</h2>

            A dwarf named Arnold joined the Task Force as Julian's replacement. After Arnold joined the Task Force, 
            the team began their second mission. Don Blue, one of the five Dons who control most of Newtopia City, 
            reported the disappearance of his daughter, Wendy, who worked at the local corner store. Wendy's trail led 
            to a rundown apartment owned by her ex-boyfriend, Mikey. After interrogating Mikey, the team learned 
            that Mikey and Wendy had a falling out, and Wendy ran off to the Casino to make some quick cash in order to leave 
            the city. A series of unfortunate events led to Mikey’s subsequent arrest. The Casino was being ran by Don Red, who 
            allowed the team back to the VIP section where Wendy was being held, after Arnold survived a game of Russian Roulette
            with the Don. Wendy was being used as a sacrifice by Countess Baroba, for her ritual to the God of Youth, Frigalhei. 
            The Task Force was able to save Wendy and subdue Baroba, but right as they were about to leave, Baroba was taken 
            back by Don Red. The Task Force was disgusted by the blatant corruption running rampant in the city, but before they could
            make changes to the way that Newtopia was ran, the Task Force members would have to improve their Star Rankings.
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Bronze Assessment</h2>

            In order to obtain power and respect in the Knight Force, one must improve his Star Ranking. At that moment, the 
            Task Force members were all Starless, but by completing the Bronze Assessment, they could rank up to obtain their Bronze 
            Stars. After taking a day off on a trip to the movies, the following day, the team took the Bronze Assessment. 
            <p></p>
            The team went through three trials: a Knowledge Test, a Fitness Test, and a Combat Test. Along the way the team 
            met a strange group of fellow examinees known as the Ab Family, who annoyed and disrupted them at every turn during the exam. However, 
            by defeating the Ab Family in the Combat Test, the Task Force managed to pass the Bronze Assessment, 
            becoming Bronze Star Knights!
            <p></p><hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Bronze Star Saga</h1>

            <h2>Wet Willy Killer</h2>

            For their first mission as Bronze Star Knights, the Task Force investigated the mysterious Wet Willy Killer, a 
            serial killer known by his calling card: giving all of his victims wet willies. Letalia found out from one of the 
            victim's teachers that all of the victims were in the same class along with a strange loxo kid. The team staked out 
            the house of Nadine Waters, the last remaining girl in the friend group of all of the victims. After some strange 
            encounters with some of the neighbors, Nadine returned after going on a date with the loxo guy, named Cheeto. Cheeto 
            was then revealed to be the Wet Willy Killer! Aphelios tried to reason with Cheeto, as they were both from Loxa Land, 
            but unfortunately, Cheeto was too far gone. 
            <p></p>
            While the team managed to subdue Cheeto, it wasn't before Cheeto managed 
            to slit Nadine's throat. Sadly, Nadine succumbed to her injuries, and died. The Task Force was left feeling defeated, 
            but JB reminded them that they must shine on, even in the darkest of nights!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Don Blue’s Party</h2>

            The Task Force was visited by Stuart the Rat and Medusa the Snake, two of the Knights of Justice from Julian’s trial. 
            Medusa distracted Arnold by taking him out for dinner, and Stuart forced everyone else to stick to the story that Julian 
            was actually a hero, to protect the reputation of the Knight Force. Letalia hung out with her friend, Wendy and watched
            a movie together. Arnold and Aphelios went to the gym to meet Chaddeus, but Chaddeus' friend, Gobo, challenged Arnold to
            a push-up competition. Gobo lost pretty badly. 
            <p></p>
            Later, the Task Force was given a strange request by Don Blue 
            to act as bouncers for a party he was throwing for his daughter, Wendy. The Task Force did well as bouncers (aside from
            an incident with a Fake Wendy), but at the end of their night, they were approached by Countess Baroba and Don Red! 
            While Arnold tried to stand his ground, he sensed the insane power of Don Red and was scared into running away. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Mother’s Day Maniac</h2>

            While on patrol, the Task Force encountered a member of the Society of Evil, an infamous group of villains. 
            After infiltrating the Society of Evil, the Task Force had a meeting that was interrupted by Kenny the Knight, who informed them that a 
            distress call had come in from a cabin in the woods, known as The Cabin. The team visited The Cabin and found the body of a girl, who’d 
            been beaten to death. Arnold and Letalia tried to find the source of a scream they heard and came face to face with a Very Large Man 
            who had one of the vacationing college students, Billy, cornered. Arnold and Letalia were no match for the Large Man’s power, 
            so they were all forced to flee on Letalia’s back, after she transformed into a horse. 
            <p></p>
            Meanwhile, Aphelios stayed back at The Cabin 
            to keep watch over the other students: Logan, Martin, and Violet. Martin tried to convince the team to cut their losses and escape, 
            as he believed the Very Large Man to be the Mother’s Day Maniac, a deranged killer who had murdered a bunch of teenagers a few years ago. However, 
            Martin ended up in an argument with Logan, as Logan didn't want to leave his friends behind, leading to a fight where Martin ended up 
            falling down the stairs and breaking his neck, killing him. 
            <p></p>
            The Mother’s Day Maniac made it back to The Cabin, and so did a crying Violet, 
            who was carrying the dead body of her dear friend, Shauna, Billy’s girlfriend. With everyone's combined effort, the Task Force and 
            the college students were able to defeat the Mother’s Day Maniac, who was revealed to be Violet’s brother, Barry Bones! 
            Violet and Barry were working together in this killer operation, so both were arrested. Logan was also arrested for the accidental 
            murder of Martin. Billy decided to become a Knight, under Arnold’s tutelage.   
            <p></p><hr>  

            <h2>Frank Bevuchet Show</h2>
            The Task Force were told by Stuart and Medusa that they were invited on to the most famous talk show in Newtopia City, The Frank Bevuchet Show,
            for catching the famous Mother's Day Maniac. On Frank's show, the Task Force gained a ton of popularity for their great responses. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force
            was visited by the leader of the Knight Force, Don Pink. Don Pink became a huge fan of the Task Force after their talk show appearance. 
            Don Pink arm wrestled Arnold and sent him crashing through a glass table, creating a crater in the ground. Don Pink made the next Bronze Assessment
            happen quicker so the Task Force could become proctors. The Task Force learned of the true power of the Don's, which they most likely got from their Holy Brands, 
            tatoo-like marks caused by forming pacts with gods. 
            <p></p>
            While on Patrol, the Task Force met a girl who was being robbed. It turns out the girl is Cheeta,
            Cheeto's little sister. Originally she wanted to kill Aphelios for putting her brother in jail, but she realized jail might be the best
            thing to help rehabilitate Cheeto. Cheeta then fell in love with Aphelios and became the leader of the Aphelios Ross Fan Club. Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia 
            all got calls from companies who wanted to sponsor them. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force then proctored the next Bronze Assessment, where the Ab Family all passed. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Silver Trial</h2>
            
            The Task Force got a call from the Society of Evil, informing them that the leader of the society had requested them. The leader of the Society of Evil,
            Flat Top, is a young man who desperately wants to change the society for the better. Flat Top believes being evil is outdated and uncool, and he
            wants to make the Society of Evil good. The Society of Evil has a bad reputation because of the actions of the previous leaders, and Flat Top thinks the Task
            Force can help with that thanks to their new found popularity. 
            <p></p>
            The Task Force takes on the Silver Trial! The first test is a Psychological
            Evaluation where The Task Force are asked questions about their goals and their beliefs. The second test is an Interrogation Test, where the Task
            Force figure out that a young man named Xavier was killed by his cousin, Wyatt. Their other cousin, Zeke, helped hide the body. Kenny breaks Wyatt's
            leg and Aphelios doesn't like that. Kenny and Aphelios then engage in a fight! Despite originally trying to stay uninvolved, Letalia and Arnold helped
            Aphelios in his fight, earning the respect of Kenny, allowing them to pass the secret last part of the Exam, the Friendship Test. The Task Force are now
            Silver Star Knights! 
            <p></p>
            JB explained his history as a Knight of Justice who lost his rank because he was trying to expose the Dons. 
            <p></p><hr>
            <br>
            
           <h1>Silver Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Father's Day Fun</h2>

           The Task Force met up at Alain's Bar for drinks to celebrate their passing of the Silver Trial. Alain allowed the Task Force to enter the VIP section of
           the bar since all of the members have at least a Silver Star. There the Task  Force encountered Violet Bones! She's now working as a singer at the bar.
           Violet managed to avoid jail time by pinning all of her responsibility in the Mother's Day Maniac murders on her brother; claiming that he manipulated her
           into helping him kill college students. Arnold managed to get Violet's number, though. 
           <p></p>
           Cliff, Cyrus, and Ned all entered the VIP section and hung out with
           their kids on the Task Force. Each dad taught their kid a new technique. Letalia learned Incinerate, Arnold learned Muscle Expansion, and Aphelios learned 
           Super Salute. Overall it's a fun Father's Day. 
           <p></p>
           Don Pink scheduled a meeting with the King, and the Task Force went to meet him. The Task Force was stopped
           by Gobo, who revealed that he is a Gold Star Knight. Gobo didn't want the Task Force bothering the King. Aphelios managed to get Gobo to agree to a staring
           contest with Letalia, and Gobo lost. Gobo tried leaving, but Arnold gave him a wedgie, so Gobo beat Arnold up. The Task Force met the King, who
           nearly executed the team, but Aphelios managed to get the King to agree to investigate the Dons. The King asked Aphelios and the Task Force to befriend his 
           son Gobo.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Investigation of Don Blue</h2>

           JB got some intel from the King that Don Blue may be up to no good. JB asked the Task Force to interrogate Mikey, because Mikey lived in an apartment that's
           secretly owned by Don Blue. Mikey was willing to give information on Don Blue, but first he wanted his jail time reduced. Aphelios managed to work out a 
           deal with Mikey: house arrest for the remainder of Mikey's sentence in exchange for information on Don Blue. Mikey revelead that Don Blue has been cutting all 
           sorts of corners on Mikey's apartment building and that Don Blue has turned a blind eye to all sorts of illegal activity. Don Pink agreed to help the Task Force 
           apprehend Don Blue. Don Pink showed the Task Force her Holy Brand power, Lovely Guardian, which should help protect the Task Force members in a fight. 
           <p></p>
           The Task 
           Force set up a friendly meeting with Don Blue to arrest him, but he eventually realized that this was just a ruse. The Task Force managed to defeat Don Blue, 
           though Don Pink was badly injured and Letalia nearly died.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Jailbound</h2>
           Kenny ran into the Task Force office and told everyone to check out the news. Abraham was announced dead on the news, and his body was located 
           at North Newtopia Hospital. Catherine and Ryu came in and arrested JB for his connection with Don Blue. This arrest order came from Don Pink. The Task Force 
           went to see Don Pink, and she explained that her father made her arrest JB. The Task Force went to see Donovan Pink. Donovan revealed that he was suspicious 
           of all of the Task Force for the missions they took for Don Blue and their relationships with Don Blue’s daughter, Wendy Blue.  Donovan asked Arnold to arrest 
           Letalia, but Arnold refused. Donovan asked Aphelios to arrest Letalia, but he refused as well. Donovan got Don Pink, Ryu, and Catherine to arrest Aphelios, 
           Arnold, and Letalia. Donovan, Ryu, and Catherine failed to get a confession out of the Task Force. Donovan told Don Pink to break Aphelios’s legs but she ran off. 
           Ryu failed to get a confession out of Arnold. Letalia spoke sheep with Catherine, which caused Catherine to fail to get a confession as well. Don Red came in 
           and pulled some strings to get everyone out of jail. He said that he got the order to let you guys out from Medusa. 
           <p></p>
           Don Red told Letalia that he babysat her 
           as a kid, that they went on roller coasters together, and that he is best friends with her father, Cyrus Winters. Letalia called Cyrus and he was very disappointed 
           that Letalia was arrested and that she had been interacting with Don Red. After a very heated conversation, Cyrus grounded Letalia, and Letalia scheduled a 
           meeting with her dad and her mother to talk about things over lunch.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Hospital Visit</h2>
           Eileen called Aphelios and informed him that JB was in the hospital! He had a heart attack from the stress of being arrested. The Task Force went to visit JB and he was
           in decent shape. Kenny visited JB and made sure he was alright before taking Eileen home. Cyrus and Letalia's mother, Evelyn, came to visit JB. Arnold tried to hit on 
           Letalia's mom, much to Letalia's dismay. 
           <p></p>
           Cyrus revealed his history with Don Red. Don Red, Don Yellow, and Cyrus were all friends at one point, before Cyrus realized that 
           they were corrupt. Cyrus investigated the Dons, but he was found out by Donovan Pink. Cyrus was saved by JB, but Cyrus was left with a scar from the encounter, and JB was beaten 
           so badly that he was severely weakened from his previous state as a powerful Knight of Justice. Cyrus and Letalia made up after an apology from Cyrus and a hug; although, Letalia 
           did try to record Cyrus's apology, before being reprimanded by her mother. 
           <p></p>
           Don Green entered the room with Medusa. Medusa revealed that Don Green is her boyfriend. Don Green is JB's 
           doctor, but Don Green took far more interest in Aphelios's body. Stuart came in and started a fight with Don Green. Aphelios was nearly knocked out from the ensuing chaos, but the 
           Task Force managed to persuade Stuart to stop. 
           <p></p>
           Stuart informed the Task Force that they had an upcoming appearance on the Frank Bevuchet Show and that they were suspended for the 
           time being. Letalia scheduled a meeting with a very upset Wendy to talk about what happened with her father, Don Blue. Aphelios and Arnold hung out with Chaddeus at the gym where he 
           informed them that he is the captain of the Letalia Love Brigade. 
           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Don Summit</h2>
           The Task Force went to the Frank Bevuchet Show and after a brief conversation with Chet Ryan, they went onstage
           and were weirded out by the questions that fans were asking. Frank Bevuchet got a message from one of his producers that a dead body was found outside of the building! The body 
           belonged to none other, than the Task Force's friend, Kenny the Knight. Ryu and Catherine came onto the scene and told the Task Force to return to HQ. 
           <p></p>
           Gobo is now the captain of 
           the Task Force while JB is in the hospital. The Task Force was chosen to act as bodyguards for the upcoming Don Summit. Letalia chose to protect Don Yellow, Aphelios chose to protect
           Don Red, and Arnold chose to protect Wendy, the new Don Blue. During the time before the Don Summit, Letalia made amends with Wendy, Arnold began dating Violet Bones, and Aphelios befriended Mikey
           after bringing him a copy of Badfellas on DVD. 
           <p></p>
           Letalia learned that Don Yellow is immortal thanks to her Holy Brand that she received from Frigalhei. Aphelios learned that Countess
           Baroba has a close connection to Don Red. Arnold mended his relationship with Wendy.
           <p></p>
           At the Don Summit, Donald Blue was pressured into resigning, and Donald chose Wendy as his successor.
           Don Pink tried to fight Don Red over it, but she couldn't manage to hit Don Red. Don Yellow revealed to Arnold that she is his aunt-in-law, and that his mother is not actually his birth
           mother. Don Yellow also revealed that Arnold's birth mother is the sister of Julian's mother, meaning Arnold and Julian are cousins.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Knight Hunter</h2>
           The Task Force went to the Nasty Burger for team bonding, where they encountered the waiter, Rick. After burgers, the Task Force went to the Society of Evil Hideout where they found
           out that Flat Top and Gobo are friends, and that the Society of Evil is trying to stop the Dons. The Hideout is going to be the Task Force's new base of operations. 
           The Task Force had some internal arguments, as Aphelios wanted to take down all of the Dons while Letalia and Arnold believed that they should help Wendy. The Task Force decided 
           that Don Green was the best person to target first. Blondie revealed that Donovan Pink is her father and that he gave her the scar on her eye. The Task Force left the Hideout to talk to
           Wendy, though, Gobo stayed back to watch Night of the Living Poop. 
           <p></p>
           On the way to Wendy's place, the Task Force was approached by a masked man who revealed himself to be
           the Knight Hunter, the serial killer who murdered Abraham and Kenny. The Task Force managed to defeat the Knight Hunter with an excellent feat of teamwork by combining 
           Disarming Attack with Command with Hold Person. Aphelios unmasked the killer and revealed his true identity: Julian Hotapepperin! Aphelios and Letalia wanted nothing to do with Julian,
           but Arnold was less antagonizing, since Julian is his cousin, causing a bit of turmoil in the group. 
           <p></p>
           Gobo regrouped with the Task Force and took Julian back to Knight Force HQ. 
           The Task Force met with Wendy and her bodyguard, Craig. Wendy wants to take down the Dons since they betrayed her father. After a passionate discussion with Wendy, the Task Force 
           agreed to become her personal bodyguards.

           <p></p><hr> 
           
            <h2>Hottest Star Island</h2>
            Chet Ryan invited the Task Force to be on his new reality show, Hottest Star Island, where contestants complete challenges to win 50K Gold and a promotion to Gold Star Knight. 
            The Task Force decided to go; they were joined by the other contestants and they were all split into two teams, Plasma Camp and Nebula Camp. Plasma consisted of Aphelios, 
            Abigail, Flat Top, and Wendy. Nebula consisted of Arnold, Abel, Violet and Letalia. The team that loses the challenge must vote off one of their members, and in the event 
            of a tie, the decision is left to a fan vote. 
            <p></p>
            After a series of competitions, betrayals, and  exits, the teams merged into the Star Team, consisting of Arnold, Letalia, 
            Aphelios, Violet, and Flat Top. The Final Two ended up being Letalia and Aphelios. Aphelios won the game with a 4-2 vote! Aphelios gave 10K Gold to Arnold, and Chet Ryan 
            gave 10K Gold to Letalia for being the Runner Up.

           <h1>Gold Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Return to Newtopia</h2>
           The Task Force returned home after their trip to Hottest Star Island. Ryu gave Aphelios his Gold Star, officially making him a Gold Star Knight! 
           <p></p>
           Gobo informed the Task Force that 
           his father, the King, was ill, so Gobo would be stepping down from the position as the leader of the Task Force to take care of him. With Gobo gone, Chester joined, and 
           Aphelios was then made the new leader of the Task Force, given that he had the rank of Gold Star Knight. The Task Force met up at JB's house, where JB informed them that he had 
           decided to retire after many long years of being a Knight. Eileen told the Task Force that she was now working at the North Newtopia Hospital. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios and Letalia went to go see
           a the Hottest Star Island: Behind the Scenes movie, where they found out that a second season of the show was coming out soon. Meanwhile, Arnold trained with Chester and Chaddeus
           at the gym. Chester could not handle Arnold's intense regimen, so Chester went home. The Task Force went to go see Flat Top, and he told them that a ton of new people joined the 
           Society of Evil after seeing Flat Top on Hottest Star Island. Flat Top also suggested that he and Aphelios should make a brand named after their alliance on Hottest Star Island,
           "Flat Peanuts". Flat Top also informed Arnold that Violet had released her new album, "Murderous Intent", and one of the songs, called "Arnie You Suck", was a very harsh critique 
           of Arnold. Arnold called Violet, and she said that the reason why she made the song was because Arnold betrayed her by voting her off of the show on Hottest Star Island. Arnold and 
           Violet decided to break up.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Jack Pepper Appears</h2>
           On his way home, Aphelios was greeted by a mysterious man, who turned out to be Jack Pepper, the leader of the Loxo Rebellion, who are trying to take over Newtopia and Loxa Land!
           Jack Pepper wants to make Newtopia and Loxa Land pay for how awfully loxos were treated in both places. Jack also wants revenge for his father's death at the hands of Aphelios' 
           father, Cliff Ross. Aphelios called his father, Cliff, and Cliff said that he did hear rumors that Carlos had a son. Cliff told Aphelios to investigate Don Green as Don Green had been 
           paying visits to Loxa Land. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios met up with Cheeta at Nasty Burger, and Cheeta, reluctantly, informed Aphelios about Jack Pepper, who was planning to start a war in Newtopia
           and in Loxo Land. Aphelios met up with Letalia, and they both interviewed Cheeto. Aphelios threatened Cheeto's sister, Cheeta, with jail time for working with the rebellion
           if Cheeto didn't give up information, so Cheeto told Aphelios that Aphelios didn't experience all of the struggles that loxos like Jack, Cheeta, and Cheeto himself experienced 
           because Aphelios grew up as a rich loxodon. Things were tough for loxos in Loxa Land, and they were also treated harshly in Newtopia. Jack met up with Cheeto prior to Cheeto's 
           incarceration. Jack informed Cheeto that a rebellion was brewing, and that Jack had been making super soldiers with the help of Don Green. Arnold met up with his cousin, Julian, 
           and Julian said that he had survived his head being split open because he was a god. 
           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Zombie Panic</h2>
           Arnold met up with Aphelios and Letalia at the North Newtopia Hospital. The Task Force heard a scream, so they
           ran inside and found out that Chaddeus and Eileen were being attacked by zombies! Chaddeus ended up getting bit by a zombie, but Letalia used her expert knowledge on zombies from 
           watching Night of the Living Poop to inform Arnold that to heal Chaddeus from his disease, Arnold would need to use Lay on Hands. 
           <p></p>
           After curing Chaddeus and saving Eileen, the Task 
           Force went into the basement of the hospital to save more people being attacked. The three people that were in danger were a woman named Bri, Abel Ab, and Abigail Ab. After being 
           saved, Bri tried to escape, but Letalia managed to stop her. Bri is actually named Abrielle, and she's the mother of Abel and Abigail! Abrielle tried to revive her dead son,
           Abraham, causing him, and other dead people to come back as zombies. Letalia threatened Abrielle with death if she didn't give up information on what was going on, so she offered
           to tell everything in exchange for a deal.
           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Loxo Rebellion War</h2>

           The loxo duo of Jean Parma and Khan A. Meri showed up and attacked! Jean was taken down when he was caught in Khan’s fireball. Abigail managed to stab Jean in the back and take him 
           down. Gobo called Aphelios and said that there’d been loxo attacks all over the city. The Task Force and co. took the loxos back to HQ. Chester joined up with the team. 
           <p></p>
           Suddenly 
           there was a loud noise! Aphelios got a call from JB saying to check the news. There’d been a jailbreak! The Task Force went to Wendy’s house to check on her and on the way they saw 
           Julian and Mida. Mida and Julian were going to get Mida to his family, and the Task Force let them go. The Task Force took Wendy and her bodyguard Craig to the Society of Evil for 
           protection. The Task Force went to the jail where they found Donald Blue who was one of the few who didn’t decide to leave. Donald said that the jailbreak was an inside job by a guy 
           named Chili Cheese. Aphelios invited Donald to help in exchange for a reduced sentence and house arrest. Arnold called Don Yellow and got her to help the Task Force fight criminals. 
           Arnold got a call from Violet who was being attacked by her brother, the Mother’s Day Maniac. Donald and Chester went to go help Violet. Aphelios called Cliff and during the call, 
           Loxoland went into chaos. Aphelios called Mikey, and Mikey told Aphelios that Wyatt’s hang out is 123 42nd Street. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force couldn’t get in contact with Cheeta, so they decided 
           to go to Cheeta’s house to check on her, but on the way they ran into Wyatt, Cheeto, and Chili Cheese. Billy, Logan, and Louisa showed up to help fight the bad guys. They told the 
           Task Force to leave while they handled the trio of bad guys, but Aphelios opted to fight alongside Billy, and he told Logan to protect Louisa. Arnold accidentally killed Wyatt with a 
           single strike of his blade. After Chili Cheese and Wyatt were defeated, Cheeto eventually realized he was outmatched, so he surrendered. Arnold got a call from Don Yellow, and she gave
           him the address to Don Green's Secret Lab where Cheeta was being held. 
           <p></p>
           At the lab, the Task Force encountered Jack Pepper, his ally Ago Asi, and another sleepy loxo. While the Task
           Force fought Jack Pepper and co., Cheeta was being held in the back of the lab where Don Green was working on starting the Elephant Instrumentality Machine. This machine had the power
           to transform everyone in Newtopia into elephants. The Loxo Rebellion's plan was to use the power of the Newtopian citizens that were transformed into elephants to overthrow Loxo Land.
           After defeating Jack Pepper and co., the Task Force rescued Cheeta and destroyed the Elephant Instrumentality Machine. While trying to destroy the machine, Aphelios accidentally shot 
           Cheeta. Don Green was infuriated, and he attacked the Task Force. The Task Force realized they had no chance against Don Green, so they ran away with the help of Medusa who had 
           arrived on the scene. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force returned to their office where they found Chester and Donald who had finished saving Violet from Barry. Letalia called Wendy and allowed her 
           to talk with her father, which made him cry tears of joy. Aphelios kept his word to Donald and allowed him to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Aphelios 
           gave Billy a letter of recommendation to become a Starless Knight as thanks for Billy's help during the war.

           <p></p><hr>  

           <h2>Post-War</h2>
           Billy came in and said to check the news. Frank Bevuchet announced that the villains had been apprehended, and thus the war was over. The Knight of Justice, Fiver the Rabbit, 
           came into the Task Force office and dropped off Julian who he defeated easily. Fiver wanted to befriend the Task Force but they were skeptical of him.
           <p></p>
           Aphelios made the decision to have Letalia hang out with Chester while Aphelios and Arnold went to check on the King. Chester revealed to Letalia that he isn’t much of a fighter, 
           and that he prefers to keep his head down and take a backseat role. Chesters social skills suck, which is why he failed the Interrogation part of the Silver Trial. Aphelios and 
           Arnold met Gobo and the sick King at the hospital. The King expressed that he knows Gobo will become a great king, and that Gobo should find a woman to start a family with.
           <p></p>
           The Task Force regrouped at the office, then Medusa, Stuart, and Ryu showed up. Medusa and Stuart promoted Arnold and Letalia to Gold Star Knights. Stuart announced that the 
           Task Force is officially disbanded! 

           <p></p><hr>  
           
           <h2>Trial of Don Green</h2>

           Donna ordered the Task Force to come with her, but Aphelios and Arnold were hesitant to do so. Eventually, the Task Force ended up relenting to Donna, and they went to Donovan Pink’s office. 
           Donovan wanted the Task Force to serve as witnesses for Don Green’s trial. 
           <p></p>
           Letalia met up with Chet Ryan at the Bevuchet studio,and she agreed to star in his new movie, the Silence of the Rams. Don Red showed up at the studio and announced that he’d be 
           in the movie as well. Aphelios visited the Society of Evil, where Flat Top announced that he was working on Flat Peanuts merch, and Aphelios offered to connect Flat Top with Rad 
           Kicks to potentially make a Flat Peanuts sneaker. Arnold got texts from both Violet and Wendy, and Arnold decided to meet up with Wendy. Arnold agreed to train Wendy so she can 
           become a powerful Don. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force participated in the Trial of Don Green, where Jack Pepper, Chili Cheese, and Jack Pepper also served as witnesses. Oxford the Ox was the judge, Stuart was the prosecutor, 
           and Medusa was the bailiff. For some reason, the Loxo Rebellion members tried to take all of the blame for the war from Don Green, but the Task Force managed to disprove their statements. 
           Don Green was determined to be guilty, and the judge ordered that he be sentenced to death. Don Green then stated that killing him would be a mistake, as his medical expertise was 
           invaluable to Newtopia. Oxford decided to go through with the death penalty, but the new king, Gobo objected, and ordered that Don Green’s fate be decided with a vote. All Knights 
           ranked Silver Star or higher would vote on whether Don Green should live or die. 
           <p></p>
           Donna visited the Task Force to ask them who they were voting for, as she was going to vote for Don Green’s death. The Task Force did not tell her, and they questioned if she’d be able to send 
           her own father to his death if he were in Don Green’s place. After Donna left, the Task Force debated what they should vote for and how they should handle Donna. Aphelios thought that she 
           should be treated no differently than the other Don’s, but Letalia and Arnold were more sympathetic to her, as she was being manipulated by Donovan Pink. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force decided to go visit Chili Cheese in jail to find out why he and his allies were so quick to give up themselves for Don Green. Fiver came into the room after hearing the 
           Team’s conversation. He asked if they could hang out and play games, but the Task Force wasn’t receptive, so Fiver decided to follow through on his orders to kill the Task Force. Apparently, 
           people who were higher up wanted the Task Force gone, as they had grown too powerful. The Task Force managed to convince Fiver to let them go, but only under the condition that they play games 
           with him everyday at 7PM for a few hours. Everyone then went to the game store to pre-order the new game, Golden Dark Online.

           <p></p><hr> 

           <h2>Golden Dark Online - Beta</h2>

           The Task Force went to the game store where Louisa works and pre-ordered Golden Dark Online. The Beta was currently out, so Fiver took the Task Force back to his messy room to play 
           the game on his high-spec PCs with Virtual Reality headsets. 
           <p></p>
           Aphelios chose the username PeanutWarrior6. Arnold chose the name, Arnold_6_9_8. Letalia chose the username BurningRose. Fiver introduced the Task Force to his online buddies, the abrasive 
           and rude, ApheliosFanXD aka Fifi, and the chill and laid-back, sweet_tooth_237 aka Sweet. The Task Force took on the Dungeon of Death where they fought a group of dangerous creatures, most 
           notably a beast with multiple blood-sucking minions. 
           <p></p>
           After beating the dungeon,  the Task Force spent some free time in the real world. Aphelios checked up on JB, Arnold began training Wendy, and Letalia worked on her blog. The next 
           day, Aphelios accidentally revealed his identity to FiFi and Sweet. FiFi then revealed that she was Eileen and Sweet revealed that he was Mikey. 
           <p></p>
           The Task Force along with Fiver, Eileen, and Mikey, took on the Glacierflame Cavern. There were various moments of uncertainty, like Aphelios repeatedly falling off of a tightrope, 
           Fiver repeatedly falling down while climbing a wall, and Letalia being trapped in an icy prison dimension, but the team managed to complete the dungeon.
           <p></p>
           Aphelios tried to reason with Fiver to get him to lessen the amount of time that they played the game together, but Fiver wasn’t hearing it. Letalia and Arnold tried to log out, but 
           for some reason the command wasn’t working. Fiver somehow removed the Task Force’s ability to leave the game. Fiver decided that he would keep the Task Force trapped in the game 
           forever in exchange for allowing them to keep their lives. Aphelios told Eileen to go get help, so she logged out, but Fiver logged out after her. Fiver returned a few minutes later, 
           and he menacingly implied that he had dealt with Eileen somehow. Fiver offered to let the Task Force go free, but only if they participated in one last game. The Task Force decided 
           to call his bluff, and they refused to play his games any longer. Fiver then left, leaving the Task Force to be stuck in Golden Dark Online, forever…
